# EEG-Emotion-Dataset
This is a dataset acquired from our experimental setup in our study of inferring human emotions from EEG signals


ABOUT THE DATASET
This data was obtained rom our experiment in which six subjects voluntereed to be subject to our study of inferring human emotions using EEG Signals.
Information on the dataset can be summarised as follows:

1) We used a 14-channel Emotiv Epoch headset 
2) We used a sampling frequency of 128Hz
3) To elicit different emotion state from subject, we used our custom made video clip attempting to envoke 5 emotions i.e., sad, scared, disgust, neutral, and amused.
4) The data posted in this reposiotory are in MAT format.
5) Only needed data has being extracted in the form of a matrix of samples X channels , with voltage amplitudes in each cell
6) To divide the large matrix of data into small matrices corresponding to the different emotion states for one subject, we uploaded an event marker text file
7) Point no. 6 above was done with respect to event markers as per our video clip.
8) The posted data is in the form of microvolts (uV)
